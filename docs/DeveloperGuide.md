## Design

### Architecture

`//include architecture diagram here`

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the HealthBud.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main Components**

`HealthBud` is in charge of the CLI to launch and the exit.

- At CLI launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At exit, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the CLI's work id done by the following components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui): Responsible for displaying messages to the user.
- [**`Parser`**](#parser): Interprets user commands and constructs the corresponding `Command` objects.
- [**`Command`**](#command): Contains the logic for executing user commands.
- [**`LogList`**](#loglist): **(New)** Maintains lists for each log type (Meal, Workout, Water, etc.).
- [**`Storage`**](#storage): Handles reading and writing data to and from the hard disk.
- [**`Data`**](#data): Holds the in-memory data (logs) of the app.

### UI

### Parser

![Parser_Class_Diagram](Images/ParserCD.png)

The Parser interface uses a series of classes to implement the various commands.

### Command

## implementation

### Add Log Command
`//TODO: include SD here`

### Delete Log Command
The delete log feature allows users to remove a log by its index in the application's log list. This feature is handled by the DeleteCommand class, which performs validation, deletion, and error handling.

1. User Input: <br>
  The user enters the delete command followed by the log's index (e.g., delete meal 3).


2. Command Parsing: <br>
The Parser converts the input into a DeleteCommand object, adjusting the index to match the list’s 0-based indexing.


3. Execution: <br>
The DeleteCommand:

 - Validation: Verifies whether the specified index is valid and corresponds to an existing meal log.

- Error Handling: If the index is invalid, an error message is returned to the user.

- Deletion: If the index is valid, the command retrieves the meal log’s details, removes the meal log from the mealLogs list, and generates a success message.

WHICH IS BETTER
![DeleteLog.png](Images/DeleteSD1.png)

Diagram Explanation <br>
1. User Input:
The user enters delete meal 3 in the CLI.


2. Parsing: <br>
The ParserManager receives the command and calls DeleteParser to interpret it. <br>
DeleteParser returns a DeleteCommand object (with the index adjusted to 0-based indexing) to ParserManager.


3. Command Execution:
ParserManager calls execute() on the DeleteCommand.
DeleteCommand invokes deleteLog(3) on mealLogs.


4. Outcome: <br>
An alternative flow distinguishes between:

- Invalid Index: An error message is returned and displayed to the user.

- Valid Index: The meal log is removed from mealLogs and a success message is shown.

This clear separation of user input, command parsing, and execution ensures that the deletion operation is handled in a structured and predictable manner.


## Recommend

### 1. Feature overview
   The RecommendCommand feature allows users to receive workout recommendations tailored to a specific muscle group. The
   command takes the form recommend <muscle_group> and responds with a set of 3 recommended exercises. This feature is
   intended for fitness enthusiasts who may need guidance or variety in their training routines.

### 2. Implementation details
   The RecommendCommand class extends the base Command class and overrides the execute method. The command supports inputs
   like recommend biceps, recommend legs, and so on. The logic of selecting which recommendation to print is
   encapsulated in a helper method getRecommendation(String input) which parses the input and returns a corresponding
   string. The execute method is kept clean and only responsible for printing this result to the console. This
   separation also makes the logic more testable, as the string-producing logic in getRecommendation() can be unit
   tested independently without checking the output stream.

### 3. Why this design
- Separation of concerns: By moving the recommendation content generation to a separate method, we improve readability
  and testability.
- Scalability: Adding new muscle groups or modifying messages is centralized in getRecommendation(), making it easier to
  extend.
- Robustness: Proper input validation and informative error messages ensure a good user experience.

### 4. Alternatives considered
- Using Enums for muscle groups: Initially considered using an enum with mappings to lists of exercises. While this
  improves type-safety, it adds overhead and less flexibility for user input variations.
- Reading recommendations from a file: Considered storing recommendations in a file, but added unnecessary I/O for a
  static set of data.

### 5. Sequence Diagrams
- {to be updated using plantUML}

### 6. Future Improvements
- Store recommendations in a config file or JSON for easier modification.


### 6. Future Improvements:
   Enhanced Search Capabilities:
   Incorporate multi-keyword search, case-insensitive matching, or fuzzy search to better capture user intent.
   UI Feedback Enhancements:
   Improve user feedback by highlighting the keyword in the matching results or providing suggestions when no matches are found.
   Support for Additional Log Types:
   As the application evolves, extend the command to support searching in other log categories (e.g., cardio or pb).
   Configuration Options:
   Allow users to customize search parameters or filter results based on date ranges or other log attributes.

## BMICommand
### 1. Feature overview:
The **BMICommand** feature allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and receive a classification (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese). It’s useful for users who want a quick health metric based on their height and weight inputs.
### 2. Implementation details:
Inherits from InputOnlyCommand (which in turn extends the base Command class) to handle input parsing.

Stores weight and height as immutable (final) fields.
### 3. Why this design:
Single Responsibility:
The BMI calculation is isolated in its own command, keeping the logic clean and focused.

Readability & Testability:
The concise code structure makes it easy to unit test and maintain.

Extensibility:
Future changes (e.g., additional BMI categories or metrics) can be made in this class without impacting other parts of the system.
###  4. Alternatives considered:
online Calculation in the Parser

Implementing BMI logic directly in the parser would mix concerns and lead to a more complex parser design.

Using an External Library

Given the simplicity of the BMI formula, an external library would add unnecessary complexity.

## AddWorkoutCommand
### 1. Feature overview

The AddWorkoutCommand allows users to track their strength training exercise in the HealthBud application.
This feature captures five key pieces of information for each workout session:
The name of the exercise, the weight done in Kg, the number of repetitions performed, the number of sets completed, and the date of the workout.
The system stores these records in a dedicated workout log list that users can view, modify, or analyze over time.

Users interact with this feature through a structured command format:
`add workout` [Workout_name] /w [weight in Kg] /r [number of reps] /s [number of sets] /d [date]

### 2. Implementation details

When users enter an "add workout" command, the system follows a defined sequence of operations to ensure proper recording of exercise data.
The process begins with the GeneralParser, which identifies the command type and directs workout entries to the specialized AddWorkoutParser.
This dedicated parser performs comprehensive validation of three required parameters:
the weight done in kg (/w) repetition count (/r), set count (/s), and workout date (/d).
Each parameter undergoes strict format checking - repetitions and sets must be positive integers, while the date must follow a valid, recognizable format.
For the workout name, the system extracts all text preceding the first parameter marker while ensuring it contains valid characters
During command execution, the system instantiates a new WorkOUT object with the verified parameters.
This immutable data object is then added to the application's centralized workout log.
All exceptions, including invalid numeric values or date formats, are caught and presented to users as actionable error messages.
### 3. Why this design

The current implementation follows several key design principles to ensure robustness and maintainability.
The command pattern was deliberately chosen to create a clear separation between parsing user input and executing commands.
This architectural decision makes the system more modular, allowing individual workout commands to be modified or extended without affecting other components.

Parameter processing follows a flexible yet strict validation approach.
By using dedicated markers (/w, /r, /s, /d), the system accommodates natural variations in command entry while maintaining rigorous data quality standards.
This design choice significantly improves user experience by accepting parameters in any order, rather than enforcing a rigid sequence.

The WorkOUT class implements an immutable design pattern for important reliability benefits.
Once created, workout records cannot be accidentally modified, which prevents data corruption and simplifies debugging.
This immutability also enables thread-safe operations, future-proofing the application for potential multi-threaded enhancements.

The parsing logic incorporates multiple validation layers for maximum data integrity.
Each parameter undergoes type checking, format verification, and range validation before being accepted.
This thorough validation occurs before any changes to application state, following the fail-fast principle to prevent partial or invalid updates.
### 4. Alternatives considered

We initially considered using positional arguments rather than parameter markers,
where users would enter values in a fixed order (e.g., "add workout [name] [weight] [reps] [sets] [date]").
This approach was ultimately rejected because it proved less intuitive for users and more prone to input errors.
The current marker-based system (/w, /r, /s, /d) provides clearer visual separation of parameters and allows for more flexible command entry.

We also explored using a single unified Log class with type differentiation,
rather than dedicated classes for each log type.
This unified approach was abandoned because it would have required extensive runtime type checking and reduced type safety.
The current specialized class structure provides better compile-time checks and more intuitive code organization.

### 5. Sequence Diagrams

### 6. Future Improvements
The weight tracking functionality will be enhanced to support more advanced strength training scenarios.
This will include the ability to record varying weights within a single workout session, such as pyramid sets or drop sets, through an expanded command syntax.




## Goals
### 1. Feature Overview

The Goals feature allows users to set and view personalized health goals within the chatbot. These include:
Daily Water Intake Goal (/w), Daily Calorie Intake Goal (/cal), Weight Goal (/kg)

### 2. Implementation Details

The goal command is implemented as part of a switch statement in the main command handling logic. Here's how it works:
Upon entering the goal command using the command "add goal", the user is greeted and shown their current goals from the
singleton Goals class instance. The chatbot enters a loop where it listens for specific goal-editing commands:
/w [value] updates the daily water goal, /cal [value] updates the daily calorie goal, /kg [value] updates the target
weight progress prompts the user to select a day to view progress data from waterLogs, mealLogs, and weight history.
The user inputs are parsed with Scanner, and exceptions such as InvalidDateException and InvalidGoalException
are handled gracefully.

### 3. Why This Design
  Simplicity: Using a command-line loop with conditionals provides clear control flow and is easy to debug.
  Singleton Pattern: Goals.getInstance() ensures consistent access and modification of user goals.
  User-Friendly Prompts: Each interaction provides guidance on valid inputs and current status.
  Separation of Concerns: Goal logic is kept distinct from log retrieval (waterLogs, mealLogs), enabling modular testing.

### 4. Alternatives Considered
   Command Pattern: We considered implementing a command design pattern to encapsulate each action
   (e.g., update water goal), but deemed it too complex for the scope.
   GUI-based input: Given the chatbot nature and CLI interaction, we opted not to build a graphical interface.
   Database-backed goal storage: For now, data is likely held in-memory for simplicity; persistent storage could
   be added later.

### 5. Sequence Diagrams

### 6. Future Improvements
   Input validation: Add regex or parsing to ensure valid numeric inputs.
   Persistent Storage: Save goals and logs to a file or database for state retention across sessions.
   Multi-user support: Refactor to support multiple user profiles.
   Goal recommendations: Suggest goals based on user history or health data.
   GUI/Web Interface: Build a frontend to visualize progress and make goal-setting more intuitive.

## Product scope
